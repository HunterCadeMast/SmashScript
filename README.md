# SmashScript

This repo has a custom programming language based on the video game franchise, Super Smash Bros. With this, I attempted to learn more about compilers and how programming languages are created, so I created this. Initially, it was for a class called "Theory of Automata" at Vanderbilt University. More information is held inside of the word document explaining the project and my work on it.
